# Interface

An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.

>Points to remember
- Interface gives full abstraction
- Multiple inheritance is possible in Interface
- Multiple implementaion is also possible
- can have default or static method

## Interface terms

>Default method

The method inside interface which can be declared and defined with in the interface without the need of having to override them in the implemented class

>Inheritance in interface

The process of inheriting a interface by another interface as it is done in the class is called inheritance in interface.
Multiple inheritance is possible in interface

>Nested interface

The process of defining a interface inside another interface or a class is called nested interface

- a object of nested interface can be made by its outer interface or the class that it implements
